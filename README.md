# CodeChef and LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various programming problems from CodeChef and LeetCode platforms. All solutions are written in Python, and each file is named after the corresponding problem for easy reference.

## Structure

- Each Python file corresponds to a single problem solution.
- File names match the names of the problems.
- Solutions cover a range of difficulty levels and topics.

## How to Use

- Browse the repository to find a problem you want to study.
- Open the Python file named after that problem to see the solution.
- Feel free to run the scripts locally using Python 3.

## Adding Your Own Solutions

To contribute your own solutions:

1. Create a new Python file named exactly as the problem.
2. Write your solution inside the file.
